# Property-Tycoon - Game Development Project
This project covers the design, development, and delivery of Property Tycoon – a digital adaptation of Monopoly. 

## Documentation Guide
* Risk Analysis and Management – Outlines all the potential risks that could arise during the development cycle of our game, its relative impact on the overall project’s successful completion and ways we could mitigate these inherent risks.
* Requirements Analysis – Provides the full list of functional, non-functional and domain requirements that guided our development process.
* High-level Design:
  * Flowcharts – Showcase the overall system behaviour.
  * Use-case Diagrams – Demonstrates user interactions with the game’s system.
* Low-level Design:
  * Class Diagram – Visually represents the structure of our codebase by depicting the classes, their methods and the relationships between them.
  * Sequence Diagrams – Illustrates the interactions between objects in the sequential order in which they occur.
*	Sprint Documentation – Each of our 4 sprints have been documented with a start and end report that tracks the tasks and objectives we set out to complete as well as the progress we made.
*	Gnatt Chart – Progress charts created to track and manage individual tasks and their corresponding deadlines.
*	Meeting Documentation: Every team meeting that was conducted in the last 9 weeks has a corresponding document that summarizes the issues that were discussed, and the decisions were made in that meeting.
*	Testing Documentation – Details the execution of testing activities, providing a clear record of test cases, expected outcomes, actual results, and pass/fail status.
*	Team Progress Meeting – Reviews progress made on the project so far roughly midway through the development cycle.

## Figma Workspace 
Figma was used to design many elements in our project including the gameboard itself, the property cards, the “pot luck” cards and the “opportunity knocks” cards. It is linked [here](https://www.figma.com/design/9kcLpGNVO8mvwCSGL5f2Fy/Property-Tycoon).
